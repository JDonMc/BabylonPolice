Miracles are performed by god, magic is performed by creature. All magic happens by metaphors that act as keystones to unlock the power, like feeling spiritually drained and having your phone battery suddenly jump flat. Or stopping smoking weed and feeling like your mind is disconnected from the unconscious network and your wifi turning off. The magicians I’ve seen mutter in uninterpretable languages, as all true-magic is concealed by a spell of not being able to copy it upon translation. People rag on gatekeeping but they gatekeep what that is, so as far as I’m concerned, it’s a null point. One may define the world as they wish.

Danielli Bolleli:

“If a parent says ‘you live under my house, you must obey my rules’ That’s a sign you’ve already failed as a parent.”

I believe this applies to the State also.

Fuck the police, when they say you can’t do drugs. Fuck the police, when they say you can’t grow avocado. Fuck the police, when they say all schizophrenics can be arrested without reason.

If someone were to take over the world with drones and bots, I guarantee you the first on the chopping block is the cop and the politician. Once they’re down, the military take over, and they take the next killshot.

The person trying to take over the world shouldn’t be concerned about a person with a plant or an illness.
