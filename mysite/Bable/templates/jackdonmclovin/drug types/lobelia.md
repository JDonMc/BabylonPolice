Published Peer-Reviewed Scientific Reporting Summary:

Lobeline bonds to the same nicitone receptors as ordinary tobacco https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26259655

Lobeline lowers P-glycoprotein activity, which can help cancer treatment in multi-drug resistance https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18222670

Lobeline is a minor diuretic, choleretic (lowers cholesterol), breathing excitement, anti-venom, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636059

Lobelia has been widely used in folk medicine in China for lung cancer and inflammation https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25787301 (NF-kappa B pathway)

Some scientists want to use Lobelia for Parkinson's and drug abuse https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105955

The last supposed overdose was in the 1850's when it was used in purified form to force someone to vomit https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2552108/

It inhibits elastase release (the enzyme that breaks down skin elasticity) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656355

Chronic treatment of mice for 3 weeks with Lobelia showed no changes in weight, temperature, or coordination and increased activity in spatial awareness and in new environments https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1831091

Rats self-administer less methamphetamine on Lobeline compared to sober https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17612524
