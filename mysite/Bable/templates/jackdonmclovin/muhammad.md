a bunch of english translations of muhammad's sayings. I thought I'd look at them from a wide-read western perspective.

1. “Be kind, for whenever kindness becomes part of something, it beautifies it. Whenever it is taken from something, it leaves it tarnished.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Don't be always kind, be kind so long as you can sustain your kindness. If excess kindness is the cause of your downfall, you will not compensate those who give insufficient kindness. Be kind, but place sustainability in front of kindness.

2. “The best among you is the one who doesn’t harm others with his tongue and hands.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- 

3. “A good man treats women with honour.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- The honour towards a person is the perspective others have of them in response to being a witness to their prior actions and it's correspondance to personal principles of ethics and responsability.  A good man treats the honourable with honour, and this is to have good judgement and takes wise discernment.

4. “The greatest of richness is the richness of the soul.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- The greatest illusions can be held in the mind.

5. “There is reward for kindness to every living thing.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Some do not seek to be rewarded for kindness, and some acts of kindness can be mistakenly offensive, there may be a reaction, but not always a reward.

6. “Strive always to excel in virtue and truth.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Be in disbelief, virtues and truths can be mistakenly believed, but to exclaim "I can't believe it" can describe good or bad news, the extreme goods are of ecstatic astonishment, the extreme bads are of plain undeniability, and it's the bad we must come to grips with plainly to counteract, not the goods we strive to attain blinded into submission by certainty. And, not fully, do I believe in this.

7. “The greatest jihad (struggle/striving) is to battle your own soul, to fight the evil within yourself.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- To believe you are struggling to fight the evil within yourself is to be a step removed from silence, and in silence we find peace and balance, and insight, because we are 'in' silence, not 'out of silence', not 'out of sound', not 'in sound'. If you are striving to fight the evil, then you must truly know what evil is, and knowing what evil is in its fullness is to know how to create evil. Do not be so certain that a spider or a snake or a lion or a shark is evil, they are creatures of nature, specialised for a purpose that does not last for long, only so long as it improves its prey enough to fight the predator for one last time, or the prey dies one last time and the predator falls with it. Evil is only evil so long as the good gets better. Evil is destroyed by naming it as its own enemy, and the good the victor so long as they are good enough.

8. “The strongest among you is the one who controls his anger.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- 

9. “God does not look at your forms and possessions but he looks at your hearts and your deeds.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- If you possess the ability to save a life, then a first aid kit is good to have around. If you form an idea of truth in your mind, it will change how you act and God will look at that.

10. “Riches are not from an abundance of worldly good but from a contented mind.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- A discontented mind is often what creates a new worldly good, and they may become rich enough to pass on richness to make contented minds.

11. “Exchange gifts, you will love one another.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Do not always exchange gifts, if you do not know what it means that you give. Buying flowers for the wrong person could start a brawl, and buying a present someone tells you they love might make a habit of lying to each other to feel better. 

12. “The best among you are those who have the best manners and character.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Those with certain manners think of themselves highly, and of certain character also. Because it's the certainty that makes you think highly of yourself. Truly, we are each nothing, and nothing is infinite. If you think of all the worst aspects of yourself, you now have something to work with, something to correct. Having manners in a gun fight will get you killed, having character at a funeral is selfishness.

13. “No two things have been combined better than knowledge and patience.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Two things combined greatly are lies and inspiration.

14. “Tell people of glad tidings and do not push them away.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Sharing glad times in speech misses glad times in presentness, if we share in speech of glad tidings, the glad tidings might just be made of speech of glad tidings, and then we chain up dead air and call it a good life. Presentness is a doorway only for those who are here and now to manage. Leave the past where it lay unless it creates the future. If you want others to know you are happy, find for them happiness that they might know how it feels that you are happy. If you want others to know you are sad, ask them to find for you happiness.

15. “The best of houses is the house where an orphan gets love and kindness.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- The best of situations is where a bad situation gets better? No, the best is disbelief that the situation is over; an orphan with kindness and not sustainability falls. An orphan with love and not boundaries makes poor decisions.

16. “The believer does not slander, curse, or speak in an obscene or foul manner.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- The worst of curses it to be told to be silent in the face of self-expression, to obey is to submit and declare them power. Yet all words may be said, but only silence believed.

17. “A kind word is a form of charity.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Charity unsustained is heartbreaking.

18. “A father gives nothing better than good education.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Sometimes, just the life is enough. A good education in your eyes is the sign of your space and your times, for the good education the child finds they must go looking and it be the last thing they find.

19. “Feed the hungry and visit a sick person, and free the captive, if he be unjustly confined. Assist any person oppressed whether Muslim or non-Muslim.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- How might the hungry have gotten hungry, and the sick gotten sick, the captive been caught? They came from somewhere and their consequences are being resolved. If you can't work for someone who can feed you, or eat what prevents sickness, how can you expect for them to own enough in order to feed themselves and then their children? If we are to organize everyone to take care, the idea must acquire that power on its own. If your people must be told to have empathy, will it last?

20. “Seek knowledge from cradle to the grave.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Seek wisdom, some lessons are learnt where knowledge knows not how to reach.

21. “Do not waste water even if you were at a running stream.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- All water is wasted. Take care to grow a forest with your wasted water to create a topsoil to hold the rain, else you create yourself a desert and have not enough to waste.

22. “A white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good actions.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Superiority is what the second best to the second last think of. The good loser believes at least he got to play, not that he lost, and the good winner knows he was unfairly matched. If you think of yourselves as superior to each other, only one man ever wins and we try and we try and we try to make that man ourself and is why so many fail.

23. “When a thing disturbs the peace of your heart give it up.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Reading has always disturbed the peace in my mind, and writing disturbs the peace of others. It's just that while peace abounds within the walls of your people, there are fights in the city and in the country and in the world. I seek to disturb the peace of everyone's peace only being alike with afew, if we are to have peace it be that all fights must be agreed to peacefully.

24. “You do not do evil to those who do evil to you, but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- It would be evil to let evil roam freely doing evil. Actions have consequences, and prior agreement absolves evil. The power may punish those under it for disobedience.

25. “He is not a true believer who eats his fill while his neighbour is hungry.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- A neighbour who waits until they are hungry to find food, will die of hunger unless they learn the first rule of what it costs to be alive, or will eat you out of house and home, only create life if you can ensure to make it good.

26. “However much the faith of a man increases, his regard for women increases.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Your faith is the words you use.

27. “What has reached you was never meant to miss you, and what has missed you was never meant to reach you.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

Thatwhich happens being meant to happen can paint a nightmare on your wall as a human, or make you think you are the god of truth.

28. “When you see a person who has been given more than you in money and beauty. Look to those, who have been given less.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

Ugliness develops either from the attitude of facial expressions creating a default muscle tension that bends bone structure, or is in the eyes of those who look to define ugliness.

29. “Speak good or remain silent.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- To bring down a bad thing is to put it in its place. To raise up a good thing is to prepare for it to be taken down.

30. “Make things easy for people and not difficult. Give people good news and bring them joy, and do not turn them away.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Make things as complex as need be to explain the truth at the level of insight understandable to those judging. The truth is far more complicated than our theories give credit, and far more simple than needing to be simple.

31. “Remember your own faults when you want to mention of others.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Remember your own faults so long as you can correct them, else let go of what brings you pain

32. “Those who are patient in adversity and forgive wrongs are the doers of excellence.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Those who are prepared for adversity, and prevent wrongs are the doers of excellence. To be patient in adversity and to forgive wrongs is the perfect thing to preach to a herd to slaughter.

33. “Modesty brings nothing except good.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- If you pat yourself on the back for being modest, you forget its a gift only others can give. And learning what others call modest tells you who to be, while telling you its not to be paraded around, that true faith is shared silence.

34. “The most perfect man in his faith among the believers is the one whose behaviour is most excellent, and the best of you are those who are the best to their wives.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- This is to say that the wife's perspective matters most, and perfection in the eye of believers is in regard to behaviour. But it is up to men to take wifes, and for believers to judge good behaviour.

35. Happy is the man who avoids hardship, but how fine is the man who is afflicted and shows endurance.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)

- Don't avoid hardship if its the best course of action, and do not endure afflictions that you can't bear forever.
