Any-Year’s Resolutions
Any-Year’s Resolutions are actions we’d like to do eventually, whether it’s in this new year or the next. Som goals are hard goals and take time and effort, and we can get distracted from anything we are trying to re5olve. Give yourself a break, a pat on the back and have a breather. Fuck it, a joint or a bong, a beer or a wine, a coffee or a redbull, a cigarette, a piece of chewing gum and some 2 minute noodles with some chilli, onions, garlic and an egg. And slowly up it as you get the chance – more substances that are relatively good (good includes risk reductive and biologically beneficial and financially feasible (risks include reliance and ruination))(maybe this statement can be taken out of context and still be useful).
