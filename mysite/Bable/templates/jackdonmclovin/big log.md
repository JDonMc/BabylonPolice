Joshua: Teenager vs Superpower
Jack McLovin  May 31, 2018
Getting paid in dollars per hour really incentivises people to waste their time.

Most employment I've either been waiting for something to do or wasting my time most of the time. This capitalist economy and mandatory schooling really has us barely trying any exploration of the world or the mind.

In Joshua vs Superpower, we see that civil disobedience is the way forward, but the police action in Hong Kong was very similar to police action in Australia, it's like all countries have the freedoms of the elected to change their minds about things, but are designed by one common strategist either in global crowd control or sleeper-minding-conscription. Much of what we do is so over the top and unnecessary and beyond what we need, but talking about things like this isn't helping, with "much of what we do", it's more of an awareness tidbit rather than edifying piece.

I look forward to seeing many more festivals where people take a lot of mind expanding substances and rethink their world, to create havens and pockets of culture, for reliability and diversity. The habits of thought in recent times have lead to a lot of dead ends. This movie is inspiring to people who hated going to school as a kid (most of us at most points before we "build a bridge" and move on), or like me and still hate it as an adult, where most of it is pre-requisite to some tailor made profession where the person is so important that they decide whether new people are admitted to the profession. Only lawyers are lawyers and doctors are doctors, but everyone has the internet so all the textbooks are parroted about online and mostly free. At different stages different professions require the others for a suitable answer in given scenarios, a doctor needs a lawyer needs an engineer to decide if something is "safe" by all non-illegal measures of "safe", which needed a lawyer to help in writing, all based off a doctors report.

It all goes around in a circle meanwhile in each cult-like "school" in an institution they circle jerk and hyperventilate on how is so much better than all the others.

When I learnt biomedical engineering I hoped to have a combined doctor's and engineer's opinion, but doctor's don't respect engineers and engineers don't respect doctors, so I ended up losing a lot of respect for myself, and they need to be mediated by lawyers, all operating on laws written by government officials, paid for by corporations. Although, that tid-bit "paid for by corporations" is getting old. I wonder if that's how we get used to things, they become old and then it inverses into a novelty again.

I just love the novelty of psycho-actives, they certainly help me to see things clearly, from my own perspective that is, it allows for transformations that re-orient reality into hyper-dimensional objects that are quite difficult to imagine without the assistance of a chemical. I just came down from transforming into a table from one such ridiculous trip. It's like double vision but more detailed and entertaining, and most importantly difficult to believe. But when it comes to experimenting with mind, one needs an important technique to verify that what happens in those states is most certainly true, or real, ie. by asking of it to change something concretely that remains when you come-down. You probably still won't believe it though. In fact, the whole experience is a test of what you can or can not be lead to believe.

Curbsider's Internal Medicine
Jack McLovin  May 29, 2018
Lectins are proteins that bind to sugar. And are found in wheat

Elimination diet: remove gluten, hard-to-digest protein. Gluten causes auto-immunity.

Multiple sclerosis is caused from myelin-sheaths being attacked by processed milk and wheat, and they need Vitamin D.

Ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting for memory problems, pre-alzheimer's can be caused by not doing so.

 

There's a lot more to diet than macro and micro nutrients, you need phytonutrients also.

Mysterious Universe
Jack McLovin  May 25, 2018
They call it a second wave of psychedelics, but a business has started under the name third wave, calling it the third wave of psychedelics.

They mentioned that someone had learned that psychedelics weren't addictive physically or psychologically but lead to changes in consciousness and no one has ever overdosed on LSD. 

They mention the amount is so small compared to the consumption of things like alcohol. The person had a high dose and had a powerful non-dual experience, where his concept of "I" disappeared and he couldn't tell if his eyes were open or closed, and he came into a space where only pure awareness existed without form or content. And into that realm came a celestial entity that was the emergence of the physical world without the boom or blinding light of the big bang. The birth of the universe. He saw planets forming and species evolving in countless worlds that words can't describe. There was no terror, and only awe. He says that consciousness precedes the physical universe. He went from being absolutely certain in materialism to being unsure, and it is a massive shift. Why wouldn't he file it under as some dream or mystical fantasy. They mention that it's more of a noetic quality of gnosis.

They mention many computer scientists in silicon valley take lsd and switch to psychedelic research.

Apparently most of the research is hidden away and hard to find.

The good friday experiments with Walter Punky and Timothy Leary, where 20 students in double-blind placebo at a chapel, had 10 of which take LSD. And almost all members who had taken LSD had a profound spiritual experiences and acute anxiety, one of which had to be injected after running up the street and proclaiming that the Messiah is coming. This could be interpreted as an "in a nutshell" summary of the conclusions of the beliefs formed by the church, like how they can simply be waiting and worshipping until he returns to explain it all for them, or at least the next part of the story. Or it could be interpreted as a psychosis of the messiah complex, which is if not stale, at least harsh and detached from the experience itself, a state of minimal integration.

They mention psychonauts and that they think of themselves as astronauts in space, and we are ground control. They are blasting off on psychedelics. They feel themselves holding on for dear life as their ego dissolves. One person remembers the words he said before taking it, to not be afraid and to go towards it. He saw an icicle that reflected a whole series of a life review, each image was a memory that could be considered. One person saw that she could name a feeling and then let it go. Although, now that's just something she can't let go of I imagine. She dealt with a lot of grief that had been living in her left shoulder.

I find that the people I've lived with have all kinds of vibes that exude onto me and I am left to identify it before I can deal with it. And it takes a certain repetitive memory to re-iterate a change into habituation, which I think could even be burnt into genetics in some instances. Like the guy I'm living with is getting very low upper eyelids, with I find to be a symptom of, well I won't go into that. But once you start noticing the body and it's expressions in reactions to situations, and become a first-person statistician, you'll see that there's a lot that's left under covers from science.

I regularly get uncomfortable and have to stretch my entire back and neck out and that's me dealing with a vibe I've picked up. And I've learned from dreams the meaning of performing a self-massage, particularly that of the parts that perform the massages. The shape of how a hand massages different areas is a metaphor for the things that appear similar in shape to hands themselves and the body parts that are being massaged. For the things that have that relationship, they too have a relationship for massage types. Which is a very curious relation that we can come back to once we find out what things can be counted on your hands, and what is like hands to the body. It takes stepwise segmented abstraction to see what I mean here. That which is like the hands to the body, is the grip of desire, or the pattern-work of clothing. Stretching out metaphors is a complex procedure and leads to infinite conception, and is not yet well understood.

I'll leave it there until I can explain further.

They mention that "how I feel" isn't currently understood as being within our control, but the science of psychedelics might help. At first they thought the first 10 or 20 people were planted because of the such rich reports they were receiving, that psychiatrics basically hadn't ever had this kind of participation and feedback before.

Bibble Babble
Jack McLovin  February 26, 2018
I'm re-translating the Bible, because frankly, all the versions I've found are biased. They start from a place of believing in the last translation they read, and they were doing it just to make money off of having their own version.

So why not do the same thing, but bias it from a point of only believing the original language in metaphorical form, from a trippers point of view.

After all, it's really god damn common to hear the voice of god on shrooms. And it's obvious that Manna was shrooms, and that Christ is a concept that came from Nag Hammadi.

It's going to be a revival of an archaic interpretation. With a lot of tongue in cheek references and extra reading into commentaries and the skeptics bible.

It's going to be pantheistic and half atheist. Believing only that God is a god of Order. That if every little thing happens for a reason, then all happens for a reason.

Why Are We So Boundary-Locked?
Jack McLovin  December 12, 2017
Can there be a form of science where you don't always assume someone is wrong. Like, start the process of getting people to read each other's stuff and get them starting to imagine what may or may not be correct, and then form a habit of detecting mistakes.

If people somehow converge on alternate truths, then there may simply need to be people that cross check other people's error checking, and there can be calculable gradients of agreement and localizable belief systems.

Open AI
Jack McLovin  September 19, 2017
The only problem with Open Source AI is that if (or once) it becomes problematic, the entire world is a battleground.

This is why most of my work remains private. The majority of my thoughts are in a language I created, one too hard for even my Mentor to understand (His IQ 160).

Any of my writings are to cultivate a community of awareness of risk and awareness of how to mitigate inevitable consequences.

I plan to posthumously publish some hard-to-understand concepts. I do not plan for them to be readily understood, but they will merely frame the world I lived in and who I was.

I once had an experience of publishing a document that caused riots around the world. A lot happened in that year before I was publicly hung. I then reincarnated and deleted the document. This is why I don't do social media, and my blog is mostly airy fairy vaguities and semi-nonsense.

English is currently around 70,000 words in the dictionary. My language breaches millions of words. I will try to remain, at least conceptually, relatable.

Mainlining Success
Jack McLovin  September 5, 2017
Surely Businesses should be regulated to the point where every position has specific titles and there is a definable route through the mess of jobs working at companies to securing a comfortable routine in an enjoyable environment. If shinola is certain, place it at the base of trees not into a ceiling fan. If regulation can generate a mimic of waterways and streamline career development to meet industry requirements reflected by pay rates, then things like CEO's and Doctors wouldn't be paid so much.

Equality distribution appears dependant on the fluidity of the means in granting an ends with some degree of immediacy. If being paid $1 million per year takes the set of PE, prior experience, then guarantee an AS, adequate supply, of P, people with D, desires containing the set of J jobs consisting of that PE.

If success could be mainlined, abundance could be rigorous and thorough, and poverty succinctly limited and equilibrated. We could make it so each only does 2 years of hard work after 20 years of fulfilling their desires in a streamlined fashion and then retire in an environment subsidised to also equilibrate desire. Subsidisation should be reserved for that which deserves it, and those areas that serve us deserve the reservation. Whether it's learning the art of studying or learning the art of making a living, the upfront costs should be fronted by those who are upfront about creating the costings; those in front.

Faith in faith is faith
Jack McLovin  August 17, 2017
People argue about what to have faith in. But simply stating to 'have faith' is not referring to having it in anything specific, to have faith in nothing, perhaps...

Faith may be merely a cornerstone idea upon which we build a structure of inner happiness, consistent continual experience of peace.

Suppose that faith can be had when this cornerstone idea is found.

Perhaps it is merely this conception of faith that is all we need to have faith in; setting a cornerstone down and saying "we will build a home for happiness here". One need not know how to build a home, but simply spend time on building it, as the experience of building is gained by experiencing building. A master is made from a student of practice.

Intolerance of intolerance is still intolerance
Jack McLovin  August 17, 2017
I think there's a misconception as to the usefulness of tolerance.

People are saying the tolerant should not tolerate the intolerant as that may lead to the defeat of tolerance. And I'm guessing they are saying that tolerance is a good thing.

All I'm suggesting is that if tolerance is good, it may be good in only a specific conception of its potential forms. That conception may be that Pure Tolerance may be a helpful cornerstone of inner peace. Allowing existence to exist simply because it does. It insists upon itself.

After that, one should not tolerate what does not allow for their survival.

Beliefs may need to be structured to build something with a function.

No true arrogance
Jack McLovin  August 7, 2017
There is a fallacy known as the "No True Scottsmans Fallacy" and it's built around rejecting arguments whereby people suggest that, in that example, no true scottsman doesn't drink mead. Or something like that. It's basically disallowing the redefinition of a concept to be beyond it's commonplace word usage.

However, I feel like redefinitions is where we find concepts that are just as rigid as before, yet more unbreakable - it's part of the pathway of memetic development of a concept into the becoming of a profundity.

A truly arrogant person would take being called arrogant as a compliment. But that's a fallacy to some, although, there may be a line of reasoning that breaks the fallacy up into itself being a fallacy. It's pretty common. No true rationalist redefines his categories! /s




"It" is good
Jack McLovin  July 11, 2017
What "it" is, it is good. It's hard to really know what it is, from a philosophical standpoint, because it can refer to as many things as I can come up with and potentially many more.

It is InfoTech, it's Ideation Transformation, it's it and "that"'s about "it" too, so any time we talk about that, then that is also referring to it. So, seeing as It is contained within the spectrum of things from here to everything, and everything is contained within the spectrum of things that we may or may not refer to as God, God being Good and it being in that list of lists of nested lists, then it must be good also.

Or at least if you choose to believe it so.

In the beginning
Jack McLovin  July 4, 2017
Some person, gender unspecified, non-constant and unquantified, decided:
How do we create light?

Step 1. Perhaps we cannot.

Step 2. ???

Step 3. Prove it.

It's a similar process to my Bucket List:

Step 1. Write my bucket list.

Step 2. ???

...

Step N. Complete all prior steps.

Step N+1. Rest In Peace
