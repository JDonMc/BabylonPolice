Equality does not exist, not in nature, not unless you consider humanity to be included within nature, to have a nature, in which case equality does exist in the nature of, if at the very least, some parts of humanity, taking into account large numbers, it means it also exists in the minds of, if at the very least, some parts of humanity, it means it also exists in the actions of, if at the very least, some parts of humanity. So equality partially exists within the actions of its believers. Actions toward equality are good and depending on what you think in regards to how does good work. If it is beneficial compared to the lack of equality, then it will become more than a partial existence, it will totally exist.
