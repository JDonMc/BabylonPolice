What if Parents were put under arrest if their child commits suicide?

“Why are you arresting me, I didn’t do anything!”

“Look it has nothing to do with me, I didn’t raise them.”
“I don’t know what I did.”

It at least puts some causal responsibility into the nurturing of a child into an adult, thus a childrearing parent should not commit to such an endeavour without first considering the consequences of the responsibility of their decisions and lack thereof. I can hardly see a line of reasoning that’s an acceptable defence as to why this shouldn’t be in place.

That is to say, if society is at fault, we each have the responsibility to improve it.

And if we bring children into a world of pain, we have to be able to explain the reasoning behind their choices.

 

It should not be assumed that all consciousness wants to exist in this dimension after such poor set and settings as cultivated in a poor upbringing. We reap what we sow, but surely, we should sow what we want to reap.

 

Would it inadvertently encourage suicide? Perhaps, for bad parents. Taking care of ‘2 birds with one stone’. But you think if parents were good they would be loved back.

I mean, can’t we all agree that society as it is with a highly corrupt capitalist material worldview needs fixing, and part of that is our moral responsibility in writing Law.

 

I believe, there exists a system of global functioning that is, for all ways we can describe it to be, entirely optimal. But what would the optimal laws look like?

Firstly, the law would be written to ensure that the retaliation not only incurs responsibility on the criminal, prevention of a repeat offence, lowers the chances of it happening in the first place, and finally confers a firstly maximally survivable (reliable) growth path, and secondly maximally ecstatic background societal atmosphere.

 

If ecstasy were, in a sense, worshipped, or attended to, I believe we would find an infinite source of ecstasy. Or euphoria or whichever is the eutopic wellness feeling in your language.
