# Unique Value Propositions and Competitor Comparison


## Features List

### Ones that are available now

Post up to 144,000 character length posts, with a title and a link, and/or an image/gif.

Content monetization options: Subscriptions (Soon: non-recurring if using crypto, ie. pro: no cost for days not used between cycles, con: must go through payment again each new cycle), one-off purchases (Soon: Warn: this is effectively a crypto-tax for those using crypto who do not pay for multiple cycles in advance, or before being cut off by end of cycle), both, preqrequisite purchases/subscriptions/both, adrevenue for auctioned off user-defined user-selected content categories (meaning with each post you can choose from your own custom categories which each have auctioned ad positions), or self-selected ads for affiliate marketers or people with their own links or products, adrevenue for user-defined keyword-definition-oriented (your definition of the keyword is displayed when the keyword is clicked while also showing the ad (think monetized wikipedia dropdowns))




### Ones that are on their way

Sell content in ETH, BTC, LTC, or XMR (minimal fees maximum velocity of money)

Sell self-selected merch from a huge range of options self-customised automatically shipped on purchase from buyer.

Video-content

Each post will have the ability to use unique-share link click-tracking (ie. any user who shares your will get a measure for how many clinks they get for you) 
- display options being: just for you; between you and the user; between you, the user, and your community; public 
- user-selected monetization/incentive mechanism options being: reward per link-click (equivalent to per view) (**share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another user viewing (**local-share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another one of your links clicked (**funneled-share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another user clicking another one of your links (**funneled-local-share-alike-incentive**);

## Reasonings for certain non-featured features

## Things to make when moving to a Linux OS.

[1] Applies to OS' including Kali, HardenedBSD, OpenBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, and Librem.

[2] The lower applies to the Apps, Scripts, Forks, and Packages to create when using [1] 


### Encrypted Drive By Default

When installing the OS, separate the boot files from the drive and encrypt the drive requiring a password, before actually booting the OS.

### CacheGit

## Set up CacheCommit mod the commit method in a fork of Git
which is a includes an optional extra flag -ts like the -m flag, except it takes in a date and a time down to the minute on a randomised second, and sets up a time-triggered shell script, like a auto-updater or a live-app, or a desktop toolbar (top on mac, bottom right on windows) to submit the commit at that time, as long as it is after the other commits with a -ts. \"dd/mm/yyyy/hh:mm\" where \":\" \",\" \"/\" are all equivalents. optionally add \"ss\" at one or two digits, and specifies the detail of the randomness, ie. set it at the start of that minute, or set it at the end, or don't set it, or set it in the middle. 

Because you may want to include one at the start of the minute, or at the end of a minute or in the middle, if you want to make it not conflict with other commands around that minute, so they can be stacked with other trigger commands 

(in case you want to auto-trigger a set of minutes for a set of commits that are divided from one big commit, and the overall commit message can be auto-attached to be subdivided and then expanded on for the appropriate areas of the code (break on file-edits per file, add filename; break on files-class-edits per class, add file-class-edit name; break on class-function edits per function, add class-function name; and others for other file types (.md .txt .doc .docx .img .png .jpeg .gif (then the same can be done for image edits into sequential steps, to show the process of photoshop and then train an AI to do it, so each step can be generative)); break on filetype) 

include minutes rounders and randomisers ie "b-" in the "mm" for bottom (0-2), randomised minute-second, or "t-" for the same but top (4-6) and "m-" for (2-4) and "--" for random, but when the first member is one the second must be "-".

Then we can also do a FixFork where you clone/fork your own app and auto test certain potential fixes at the same time, for situations where there are many possible fixes, and you don't know which one will work. So if something breaks or was already broken, you can design an AI to trigger from the information you provide it about the break and then auto-search-scrape for potential fixes and then test out each simultaneously, so if something takes a long time to test (like compiling an app, requiring a download or install, testing possible versioning differences, not knowing if something is vulnerable until you audit it, etc.)

And a secondary optional flag -break that allows you to specify the breaking rules for the commits.


## Set up a temp export script

temp export exports the specified variable to a temp_hold_varname and then exports the specified variable to the original variable name, and can be called by eg. `temp export PATH=...:$PATH` which does 

```
export TEMP_HOLD_PATH=$PATH
export PATH=...:$PATH
```

and `temp unexport PATH`
which does
```
export PATH=TEMP_HOLD_PATH
```
seems unneccessary but means you don't have to write out all of it and custom specify the temp varname.

This allows you to write
```
temp export PATH=...:$PATH && command set && temp unexport PATH
```
which allows you to have log vars set in particular scripts that turn off when you leave, so they don't hold and apply all the time or for other scripts that you don't want the flag to apply for.



## Don't know yet

You can only control your language if you choose to define it and use it for something, and be able to refer back to it, and then to sequentially improve it, while still being able to refer back to the previous, and to use them as individually different. Because all notions are historical notions. Even here in this very text.

If it is implicit, then put it at a cost. Because mine is apparently forever cheap. Talk is cheap so you say "and you should pay less", instead I would say "talk to play". The game was set in motion and act was to tell all motion of all possible motion. Now if you think that is a variable as a part of a category of numbers, then you're mistaken as to the task of apprehension. You do not speed up to take in. You read in to take in, and then you read all until you have tell all to tell about it.

And then with potential in your hand, possibility was in the midst of land, that potentially you could be right. Assuming potentiality was such that probability, AS A CONCEPT, even originally existed. Likelihood, or boundaryhoods, or significance, or some other measure. They perform an experiment that will last like a minutea of the past. Rather to act on it here in the present. "I don't fucking know and to whoever else doesn't I don't care, but if I think I know, then I'll know I know and then the experimental measurements would be itself an impact." If you had to work it out; you could guess. Guess and check. The basis of all pre-conditions. And now good luck getting that to work with quantum computers. It's cat and mouse. You're thinking about a mouse in a box. Schrodinger's mousetrap. Fucking playing gotchya with Mr I wish it could. If observing it is an impact quit staring at it's potential. Potential, potential for what?  Potential for impact? If it happening is the measurement, then that's already the impact. Go home to bed or work in a circus. If you can't do it and nobody is allowed to know how to, then what are you doing that I think you shouldn't be doing. Global conspiracy of a psyop if I ever could smell one. People who don't know how to cause trouble don't know where trouble comes from. But you can know how to cause trouble and not cause trouble. You can be an anti-virus to the wind. Steer magellan's ship like it's your only road home. Because after that the fact is an existence. Winds don't pass wind, they breeze and then they blow, and then they dwindle until she drops.
