There are many magic tricks, many more that I use than I have heard about. One of my favourites is magic. Making a statement that even appears true to a logician and then attaching all kinds of loose magic around it to project a certain perspective that is defined well enough to implant, or inspire, a belief.

A favourite of mine is "everything is everything", which can be read as "every thing is everything" and "everything is every thing" and "every thing is every thing". Each has it's own pockets of knowledge, potential ways to be translated to describe something potentially true.

If every thing were everything, and [everything were god], then a tree is god, a dog is god and I am god. If everything were every thing, then god is a tree and a dog and me. If every thing were every thing then a dog is a tree is me.

And it is true if you look at it in the correct way. It's talking about metaphors, about how both a tree and a dog are nouns, are life, are chemical soup, are energy. There's always a relationship between any two things.

Try it out, grab a tautological statement and see if you can turn it into magic. It starts by slightly changing the definition of one half of the tautology.
