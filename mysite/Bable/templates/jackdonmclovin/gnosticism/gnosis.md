Gnosis
Gnosis is the sudden feeling that brings a knowing that the ineffable is really god damn hard to express, and even though that's a defined fact, expressing it in the here and now is an expression that means "gnosis" is that ineffable experience, and that the whole religion is birthed out of this one inner feeling.

As a gnostic, I believe that faith can thread a camel through the eye of the needle.

Now, the eye of a needle is actually the entry way to a fortress, narrow such that no weapons or luxury can enter on the camel.

Thus, Gnosis is that entry way, that feeling that we have inside is all we have, and no inherited words or past ancestral spirituality is any different than the you that you are feeling what it means to be alive. Faith is a community founded on that feeling without any strength or power other than the individual themselves.

However, to me, my form of gnosticism, I believe descends from a sect of judaism that believed that rapturous epiphanies were like God and should be, in a sense worshipped, and chased. That is, after all, how we go on to understand things.

Gnosis is birthed out of having one or two too many really really big epiphanies.
