Skeptic
So, skeptic. Have you tested the force of friction for yourself? Would you be surprised to know the standard deviation on that?

Do you understand ball lightning or lightning itself? Do you understand quantum superposition combined with classical mechanics and distortions with imaginary light speed?

No? Then what's the point of being skeptic?

One cannot be skeptical of skepticism, else they would be a skeptic.

So you either are a skeptic or you are and you don't know it, or you aren't, which means you're gullible.

The attitude of a skeptic gets unto itself (what it deserves - karma is a bitch)

Christians say skeptics are full of doubt, but gnostics say that you may doubt all you like, you'll know when it hits you in the face.
