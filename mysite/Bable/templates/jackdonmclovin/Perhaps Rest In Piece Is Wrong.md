Perhaps Rest In Peace Is Wrong
Why is it that we think not being here, in this world, guarantees that we are in peace? This shows that we either do or did have the perspective that this partially-known section of existence is not peaceful. How can we even begin to compare the amount of peace in this world to that of every other? This is an infinity problem*. There’s potentially infinitely many sections of existence that are more peaceful than this and potentially infinitely many sections of existence that are less peaceful than this. How are we to compare two infinite unknowns with each other?

Rest In Peace seems like a bit of cultural bullshit. A tradition of happenstance holding potentially no meaning whatsoever. The afterlife, if it exists, could be horrendous turmoil, constant stress and maintained total lack of completion and success. It could also be pure nothingness, a peace of mind without the need nor want to act upon anything, nor the ability to do so – being-ness without changeability, form without function (it’s a common design principle that “form follows function”, thereby, perhaps, “formlessness follows a lack of function”)*.
