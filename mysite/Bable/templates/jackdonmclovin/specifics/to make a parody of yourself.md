erhaps one can make a parody of themselves.

It's like the extra layer of evolution over the top of cringe.

A person can be cringeworthy by honest naivety, but a person can also be fully aware of what they are doing and act in a way that parodies their own behaviour.

That is to say, to go full-steam with cringeworthy behaviour with that same honesty in wanting to express the parody that is the biology of life. Like "oh woe is me, I'm suicidally in love with my sureness of unsureness in why it is that even go on living." That is to say "I'm bored and I like talking about things no matter how precipicial (to walk on a precipice) they become."

Which is also to go about saying things like "I love you" to a stranger, or "I'm in entirely and wholly in love with you and I haven't even met you and don't know the slightest thing about you," and other supposedly incredibly cringeworthy behaviours, or so according to Internet culture.

To walk in folly may be foolish, but you never argue with a fool because they bring you to their level and beat you with experience. So a person who would become a fool and walk in folly would only be to become experienced at teaching you a lesson on your level.

Who would ever become a fool?

Although, most lessons repeat themselves and it is merely the fool who wins.

Proverbs 26:4-5
"Don't ask a fool to answer for his folly, else you wish to be like him.

Ask a fool to answer for his folly, else he doesn't know what he's talking about."
