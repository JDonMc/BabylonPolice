This one's pretty short and sharp for now,

Hitchen's Razor is: that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

Hitchen's Razor has been asserted without evidence, therefore it can also be dismissed without evidence.

 

I will not be using logic that relies on Hitchen's Razor, unless I find evidence for it. In my experience, evidence free assertions allow for things like Hitchen's Razor, once it's unequivocal, I may begin to think differently.
