Occam's Gear is a list beyond Occam's Razor, but let's clarify that first:

[1] Occam's Razor:

The theory with the least assumptions is the simplest. (NOT THE BEST NOR CORRECT ONE)

[2] Occam's Comb:

Complex explanations must be combed through, aligned and ordered like hair on your head, and remove all the ticks and nits disposed. Only then can we attempt to find truth.

[3] Occam's Heart:

The theories we love the most are the ones we spend the most time proving.

The theories we fear the most are the ones we spend the most time avoiding.

[4] Occam's Subconscious / Synchronicity:

The theories we avoid the most are the ones that are most worth exploring

[5] Occam's Eyes:

The theories we read about and listen to are the ones that we are more likely to achieve consensus upon as being correct.

[6] Occam's Wallet:

The theories that make the most money are the ones with the ability to present themselves for reading and listening.

[7+8] Occam's "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is":

Eating up the theories that are most presented isn't actually a nutritious enterprise.

+

Financing the theories that you talk about generally has the incentive of boosting your ego.

[9] Occam's Ballsack:

The theories that are most reproducible and modifiable and able to be bred with other theories are most likely to be talked about repeatedly.

[10+11] Occam's Cock:

The theories that get you hard will be sold to you like viagra, and you will buy it.

+

The theories that make your tool longer (life extension) will be sponsored via [3+8] to you and you will never believe them.

[12] Occam's Arsehole:

The theories that seem like shit will drop to the floor and simply given away, and will later be reworked into fertilizer and sold to you for flowers via [6+3].

[13] Occam's Foot:

The theories that allow you to stand up for yourself as independent people will make you feel like going for a walk with them (pretty much a re-working of [3], except it involves wishful thinking that "transparency" is good in a militarized and fearful world).
