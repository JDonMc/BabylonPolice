		I (Jack Don McLovin, the Creator) am also an active scientist and wrote a research paper on the concept of this platform before building it. So here it is.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

		<h2>Ascent-Incentivised Linguistic Database, with the capability for Attention-Span-Optimised Sorting and Tradeable-Mood-Preconditioning</h2>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Goal: The database is being built along the model of Social Media platforms, for the sake of the designer who has become <b>bored with the perspective of how ordinary platforms operate</b>, and it combines with a Secret-Services-Security-Intelligence Database model, as well as being crucially important for the continuation of the designers understanding of mapping out their own dreamscape.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

		This is a project that the designer would use on their own, even if no one else was using it. Although, it is no stretch of the code to manage the system for many users.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		It is both a way of conferring the knowledge acquired in <b>Psychedelic</b> / Dream / Psychotic experiences to others, as well as improving a person's understanding of <b>symbolism</b> and why <b>what they say may not be perceived in the way they intended it</b>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Theoretically, it should function as a technique for <b>habituating consciousness to speak on behalf of each other</b> only for that which one knows is worth speaking about, and, to habituate consciousness to recognise greater and greater insight with less and less effort. The system scales with any idea of the "singularity" or "exponential growth".
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Archaic historical accounts suggest that such an idea may result in blurring the boundaries between cultures, religions, and languages, or set up very hard-and-fast boundaries between them, or both, or some mix between. Different for different.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Early on, it may appear confusing, frustrating, and chock-full of ulterior motives. However, the designer sees it as the only way to ensure that the user (himself) can proceed in both a deeper understanding of the natural world and the other people in it.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>The trick to the ascent-incentivisation</b> is that when you buy/subscribe (or for free) a dictionary off of another user, you then get access to the ads that have been supplied by others with that same access. This allows you to earn specific revenue for posting/commenting/voting based on what dictionary you are using.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		This extends further into that dictionaries can be built to have pre-requisite dictionaries. Thus when you are finished with the first dictionary, or have earnt enough from the first dictionary, you can then afford to buy the next dictionary, and then get access to a deeper layers of ads, likely with a higher pay rate. People in Marketing often talk about "funnels", but this is extended to whatever depth you would like. So if you find your first dictionary has gotten popular (which you may even offer for free), then you can start working on the next layer in, and so on as your popularity grows, providing deeper analysis, or, in particular, deeper code words, or even, the same words you used before, but with different definitions, meanings, interpretations, etc.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Now, <b>words are automatically dynamically hyperlinked in posts with less than 280 characters</b>(similar to some addons for WordPress or a standard Wikipedia article) and each hyperlinked word is given a dropdown with the associated definition for the word appearing along with an ad, whereby <b>the advertiser is forced to be transparent on what definitions they support, and what keywords they want you to use</b> thus we can de-in-bed the language in use and the corporations corrupt motives.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		One reason for forcing words to show their definitions is that at different times the same person can say the same word to mean many different things. And while, as a scientist in many different fields, this is very apparent and clear to me that everyone does this with or without realising it, it is an apt time (NOW) to start displaying that in the process of actuation.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Why this platform and not others?</b> Well, don't you want <b>control of your own language</b>? You don't have to create it for yourself, but you can now choose what your words mean and how to use them, and to join the communities that follow your path. Academia is highly corrupt. They are ruled by a curriculum, their <b>science is bought and paid for</b> with ulterior motives. NDA's are signed and the public never knows the true reasons behind what a company does. I don't employ anyone so there are no NDA's, which means I am the sole point-of-fault for transparency, honesty, and truthfulness. So it is up to the public, the users, the creators, and the advertisers, to keep me in check.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

	</div>
	<div style="margin-top: 20px; font-family: FS Kim,Georgia,'Serif';">
		Defining your terms is about as much as defining as it is about being definite, dealing with strict logical outcomes.
		<br/><br/>
		Post content is marked "|safe" thus you can use classic HTML (a href and img) to put links to words in-text, allowing the same word to have different definitions, and different words to have the same definition. This is useful in the case that you have multiple definitions for the same word. Or multiple words with the same definition. This is good for when you want to talk about technicalities amongst many different dictionaries.
		<br/><br/>
		Sponsor a word to support it's definition and the max of all the word sponsors displays on the dictionary preview. Spaces can be bought and sold, so for a historical curation sell for a fee, for a continuous curation sell as a subscription.
		<br/><br/>
		<h4>Editors of The American Heritage Dictionaries - The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language-Houghton Mifflin (1994)</h4>
		Computers—machines that some of us still think of as fast number crunch- ers—can encode, manipulate, process, and in a limited way understand language only because of the remarkable properties of natural language systems as they have evolved through a long history. In its essence, language is a hierarchically organized structure of symbols, which allows us to express a potentially infinite number of ideas through finite means. The basic building blocks of this system are very few: a set of contrastive sounds—the phonemes of the language—that we can represent by letters and letter combinations in our alphabetical writing systems. These elementary building blocks are combined in highly restricted ways into the basic meaningful units, the words of the language. These words, again in accordance with systematic combinatory principles, form meaningful sequences of syntactically well-formed sentences. The entire system thus consists of combining a finite inven- tory of discrete units into a potentially infinite set of discourses, just as the ten numerals of our number system can be combined into an infinite set of different mathematical values and expressions.<br/><br/>
		This analogous organization of language and numeric systems makes it easily possible to represent linguistic units by numbers and to manipulate them as if they were mathematical objects. Having a computer find a misspelled word in our doc- ument is not magic: if the machine has a lexicon available, with words coded as numbers, it can compare the numeric code of the word we write with the numerical value of the word in its word list through a simple arithmetical operation. If no match is found, our word is not in the computer’s lexicon, and we have a good can- didate for a misspelling.<br/><br/>
		EFFICIENCY AND REDUNDANCY<br/>
		But languages—as they have evolved spontaneously in communities over the ages—possess much more complex mathematical properties than those resulting from a hierarchical structure of discrete units. Languages exhibit both efficiency and redundancy, two contradictory characteristics balanced against each other to achieve both a communicational usefulness and reliability.<br/><br/>
		Consider redundancy first: of the 33 or so phonemes of English, only a small subset of their possible permutations can form actual words. Adult English speakers know, for example, that trip is an English word. But they also know that tlip is not an English word and do not have to go to a dictionary to discover that fact. Intuition tells them that no English word can begin with tl-. But when faced with trin, English speakers—though not recognizing the word—may have to seek help in a dictionary. The form trin is at least theoretically a possible English word because it does not vio- late any of the general constraints on permissible sequences of English sounds.<br/><br/>
		Of course, the constraints on the permissible sequences of sounds that are used to achieve this redundancy may differ substantially from language to language; there are many languages, for example, in which a word can begin with the initial tl- cluster prohibited in English. The same is true on higher levels. English—a config- urational language that relies on word order to signal many grammatical func- tions—imposes severe restrictions on possible sequences of words within a sentence. Languages with a “free” word order, such as Latin or Russian, allow seem- ingly endless permutations of words.
		<br/><br/>
		These permutations are possible because these languages have an elaborate system of inflected forms and paradigms in which a small set of endings is combined in highly restricted ways with the stems of the word to signal the syntactic relations that are achieved through word order in English.<br/><br/>

			<br/>
			13. Governing Law and Venue
			We want you to enjoy BabylonPolice, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to raise it and try to resolve it with us informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns here or by emailing us at contact@BabylonPolice.com.
			<br/>
			Except for the government entities listed below: any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be governed by the laws of California, other than its conflict of laws rules; all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California; and you consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts.
			<br/>
			Government Entities
			<br/>
			If you are a U.S. city, county, or state government entity, then this Section 13 does not apply to you.
			<br/>
			If you are a U.S. federal government entity: any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be governed by the laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of California (other than its conflict of law rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California.
			<br/>
			14. Changes to these Terms
			We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an internal message to the address associated with your Account or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective.
			<br/>
			15. Additional Terms
			Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by BabylonPolice (“Additional Terms”). To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms govern with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.
			<br/>
			If you use BabylonPolice Premium or Virtual Goods, you must also agree to our Terms for BabylonPolice Premium and Virtual Goods.
			<br/>
			If you use the self-service platform for advertising, you must also agree to our Terms for Self-Service Advertising.
			<br/>
			If you use our public API, you must also agree to our BabylonPolice API Terms of Use.
			<br/>
			If you use BabylonPoliceGifts, you must agree to the BabylonPoliceGifts Terms of Service.
			<br/>
			If you use AI, it needs to have the first two letters as AI or the last two letters as AI, or both. (To be released)
			If you use trickle, it sponsors all the words of the authors who have posted in a space made from the words in the sponsorship phrase that are in that sponsored word's author's total dictionaries. That is, if you stamp a phrase with trickle, it attaches to anyone who has given the user feedback, so it marks the whole crowd. And now that it's on a new author, the next trickle goes again, but it's on all of their words now.
			If the token is ever declared a currency then this will be a deductible.
			Each trickle costs 1000 tokens.
			It's for network affects of mass advertising, or flash advertising. If your campaign wants instant feedback, use higher trickles, but any more than about 3 trickles is probably just going to reach everyone and dissipate in no time.
			If you sponsor, you must obey the whole of advertising standards and regulation.
			<br/>
			16. Termination
			You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and discontinuing your use of all Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your Accounts, your Accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.
			<br/>
			We may suspend or terminate your Accounts, status as a moderator, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for any or no reason, including for a violation of these Terms or our Content Policy.
			<br/>
			The following sections will survive any termination of these Terms or of your Accounts: 4 (Your Content), 6 (Things You Cannot Do), 10 (Indemnity), 11 (Disclaimers), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Governing Law and Venue), 16 (Termination), and 17 (Miscellaneous).
			<br/>
			17. Miscellaneous
			These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your access to and use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may freely assign these Terms.

		Goal: The database is being built along the model of Social Media platforms, for the sake of the designer who has become <b>bored with the perspective of how ordinary platforms operate</b>, and it combines with a Secret-Services-Security-Intelligence Database model, as well as being crucially important for the continuation of the designers understanding of mapping out their own dreamscape.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

		This is a project that the designer would use on their own, even if no one else was using it. Although, it is no stretch of the code to manage the system for many users.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		It is both a way of conferring the knowledge acquired in <b>Psychedelic</b> / Dream / Psychotic experiences to others, as well as improving a person's understanding of <b>symbolism</b> and why <b>what they say may not be perceived in the way they intended it</b>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Theoretically, it should function as a technique for <b>habituating consciousness to speak on behalf of each other</b> only for that which one knows is worth speaking about, and, to habituate consciousness to recognise greater and greater insight with less and less effort. The system scales with any idea of the "singularity" or "exponential growth".
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Archaic historical accounts suggest that such an idea may result in blurring the boundaries between cultures, religions, and languages, or set up very hard-and-fast boundaries between them, or both, or some mix between. Different for different.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Early on, it may appear confusing, frustrating, and chock-full of ulterior motives. However, the designer sees it as the only way to ensure that the user (himself) can proceed in both a deeper understanding of the natural world and the other people in it.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>The trick to the ascent-incentivisation</b> is that when you buy/subscribe (or for free) a dictionary off of another user, you then get access to the ads that have been supplied by others with that same access. This allows you to earn specific revenue for posting/commenting/voting based on what dictionary you are using.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		This extends further into that dictionaries can be built to have pre-requisite dictionaries. Thus when you are finished with the first dictionary, or have earnt enough from the first dictionary, you can then afford to buy the next dictionary, and then get access to a deeper layers of ads, likely with a higher pay rate. People in Marketing often talk about "funnels", but this is extended to whatever depth you would like. So if you find your first dictionary has gotten popular (which you may even offer for free), then you can start working on the next layer in, and so on as your popularity grows, providing deeper analysis, or, in particular, deeper code words, or even, the same words you used before, but with different definitions, meanings, interpretations, etc.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Now, <b>words are automatically dynamically hyperlinked in posts with less than 280 characters</b>(similar to some addons for WordPress or a standard Wikipedia article) and each hyperlinked word is given a dropdown with the associated definition for the word appearing along with an ad, whereby <b>the advertiser is forced to be transparent on what definitions they support, and what keywords they want you to use</b> thus we can de-in-bed the language in use and the corporations corrupt motives.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		One reason for forcing words to show their definitions is that at different times the same person can say the same word to mean many different things. And while, as a scientist in many different fields, this is very apparent and clear to me that everyone does this with or without realising it, it is an apt time (NOW) to start displaying that in the process of actuation.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Why this platform and not others?</b> Well, don't you want <b>control of your own language</b>? You don't have to create it for yourself, but you can now choose what your words mean and how to use them, and to join the communities that follow your path. Academia is highly corrupt. They are ruled by a curriculum, their <b>science is bought and paid for</b> with ulterior motives. NDA's are signed and the public never knows the true reasons behind what a company does. I don't employ anyone so there are no NDA's, which means I am the sole point-of-fault for transparency, honesty, and truthfulness. So it is up to the public, the users, the creators, and the advertisers, to keep me in check.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

	<div style="margin-top: 20px; font-family: FS Kim,Georgia,'Serif';">
		Defining your terms is about as much as defining as it is about being definite, dealing with strict logical outcomes.
		<br/><br/>
		Post content is marked "|safe" thus you can use classic HTML (a href and img) to put links to words in-text, allowing the same word to have different definitions, and different words to have the same definition. This is useful in the case that you have multiple definitions for the same word. Or multiple words with the same definition. This is good for when you want to talk about technicalities amongst many different dictionaries.
		<br/><br/>
		Sponsor a word to support it's definition and the max of all the word sponsors displays on the dictionary preview. Spaces can be bought and sold, so for a historical curation sell for a fee, for a continuous curation sell as a subscription.

		<h4>Editors of The American Heritage Dictionaries - The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language-Houghton Mifflin (1994)</h4>
		Computers—machines that some of us still think of as fast number crunch- ers—can encode, manipulate, process, and in a limited way understand language only because of the remarkable properties of natural language systems as they have evolved through a long history. In its essence, language is a hierarchically organized structure of symbols, which allows us to express a potentially infinite number of ideas through finite means. The basic building blocks of this system are very few: a set of contrastive sounds—the phonemes of the language—that we can represent by letters and letter combinations in our alphabetical writing systems. These elementary building blocks are combined in highly restricted ways into the basic meaningful units, the words of the language. These words, again in accordance with systematic combinatory principles, form meaningful sequences of syntactically well-formed sentences. The entire system thus consists of combining a finite inven- tory of discrete units into a potentially infinite set of discourses, just as the ten numerals of our number system can be combined into an infinite set of different mathematical values and expressions.<br/><br/>
		This analogous organization of language and numeric systems makes it easily possible to represent linguistic units by numbers and to manipulate them as if they were mathematical objects. Having a computer find a misspelled word in our doc- ument is not magic: if the machine has a lexicon available, with words coded as numbers, it can compare the numeric code of the word we write with the numerical value of the word in its word list through a simple arithmetical operation. If no match is found, our word is not in the computer’s lexicon, and we have a good can- didate for a misspelling.<br/><br/>
		EFFICIENCY AND REDUNDANCY<br/>
		But languages—as they have evolved spontaneously in communities over the ages—possess much more complex mathematical properties than those resulting from a hierarchical structure of discrete units. Languages exhibit both efficiency and redundancy, two contradictory characteristics balanced against each other to achieve both a communicational usefulness and reliability.<br/><br/>
		Consider redundancy first: of the 33 or so phonemes of English, only a small subset of their possible permutations can form actual words. Adult English speakers know, for example, that trip is an English word. But they also know that tlip is not an English word and do not have to go to a dictionary to discover that fact. Intuition tells them that no English word can begin with tl-. But when faced with trin, English speakers—though not recognizing the word—may have to seek help in a dictionary. The form trin is at least theoretically a possible English word because it does not vio- late any of the general constraints on permissible sequences of English sounds.<br/><br/>
		Of course, the constraints on the permissible sequences of sounds that are used to achieve this redundancy may differ substantially from language to language; there are many languages, for example, in which a word can begin with the initial tl- cluster prohibited in English. The same is true on higher levels. English—a config- urational language that relies on word order to signal many grammatical func- tions—imposes severe restrictions on possible sequences of words within a sentence. Languages with a “free” word order, such as Latin or Russian, allow seem- ingly endless permutations of words.
		<br/><br/>
		These permutations are possible because these languages have an elaborate system of inflected forms and paradigms in which a small set of endings is combined in highly restricted ways with the stems of the word to signal the syntactic relations that are achieved through word order in English.<br/><br/>

			14. Changes to these Terms
			We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an internal message to the address associated with your Account or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective.
			<br/>
			15. Additional Terms
			Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by BabylonPolice (“Additional Terms”). To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms govern with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.
			<br/>

			If you use AI, it needs to have the first two letters as AI or the last two letters as AI, or both. (To be released)
			If you use trickle, it sponsors all the words of the authors who have posted in a space made from the words in the sponsorship phrase that are in that sponsored word's author's total dictionaries. That is, if you stamp a phrase with trickle, it attaches to anyone who has given the user feedback, so it marks the whole crowd. And now that it's on a new author, the next trickle goes again, but it's on all of their words now.
			If the token is ever declared a currency then this will be a deductible.
			Each trickle costs 1000 tokens.
			It's for network affects of mass advertising, or flash advertising. If your campaign wants instant feedback, use higher trickles, but any more than about 3 trickles is probably just going to reach everyone and dissipate in no time.
			If you sponsor, you must obey the whole of advertising standards and regulation.
			<br/>
			16. Termination
			You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and discontinuing your use of all Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your Accounts, your Accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.
			<br/>
			We may suspend or terminate your Accounts, status as a moderator, or ability to access or use the Services at any time for any or no reason, including for a violation of these Terms or our Content Policy.
			<br/>
			The following sections will survive any termination of these Terms or of your Accounts: 4 (Your Content), 6 (Things You Cannot Do), 10 (Indemnity), 11 (Disclaimers), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Governing Law and Venue), 16 (Termination), and 17 (Miscellaneous).
			<br/>
			17. Miscellaneous
			These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your access to and use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may freely assign these Terms.
