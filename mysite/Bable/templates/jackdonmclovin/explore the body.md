The Body Of Water That Is To Surf The Web
I've caught a fish, even though Moby dick has sunk me ship. Interesting how metaphors apply here...

Anyway, here's a collection of all the documents I've downloaded and am looking at. Google Scholar has me banned because of the sheer quantity of downloads, even though I don't use a bot to do it, they are all handpicked, downloaded for personal use. Here they are under the broad categories:

(Search for the titles, in most cases there's only one article associated, but the links often die, so I have not referenced them, but have an archive saved of each of the following articles. If there is no commentary, it's somewhere along the stages of being downloaded, printed out, read through, highlighted, rested, re-read, and critiqued.)

The deleterious effects on memory for a serotonergin (cannabis or psychedelics) can be directly attributed to the enhanced cost due to higher interconnectivity of the overall brain network. It's one of my aims to prove this in future studies on the brain.
it's simply a matter of a gross calculation for the effects of a serotonergin on the receptor active site's ATP to ADP degradation and the action potential duration decrease energy value
To me it's one of the key insights into the function of usage for these substances.
Thus it can be said that the oneness one experiences in an overall brain wide ego death is ultimately lost in the waves of memory. The highest of frequency brain signals ultimately are the hardest to move into and remain strong in, and once left from are the hardest to regain. As delta wavelengths are a baseline for human experience as signified by arising through what we actually call deep wave sleep.
in the REM pattern of every 90 or so minutes.
A direct harmonic of the 60 Hz electrical signal passing through our electrical wiring in our homes and on our roads.

Looped evolutionary theory is a theory I'd like to set out to prove by using the waste bio-mass of living forms' molecular structures to reproduce with viruses the first known cell and the first known molecular structure.
Looped evolutionary structures would be hyper-realizeable in a looped-historical timeline in which infinite frequencies (recursions) are readily available in the human-serotonergin-overdose / ego-death delta impulse known as the dirac delta which can be used to radiologically long distance identify human cases of ego death. This is likely the case in which electrical time varying signals and history are two distinct ideas, and also likely the case when non-rigid-memory structures appear in serotonergic states (particularly salvia divinorum; visual representations of altered space-time continuua that render records of historical occurrences inconsistent with memory within the visual field (true magic / miracles))

Humanities:
On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-profound Bullshit:
The authors define bullshit statements as consisting of buzzwords randomly organised into statements with syntactic structure but 'no discernable meaning', however, I would argue all well structured statements have the potential for meaning. They give an example of such 'bullshit' "Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena", and I would argue that it is indeed profound because it stretches the definitions of each individual word to mean something along the lines of combining Plato's "time is the moving image of eternity" and Abhijit Naskar's "in the emptiness of the mind, lies wholeness". It seems more-so that what qualifies as profound requires some element of novelty, a unique ordering of concepts into a new perspective of an old truth, and randomly generated statements are more likely to be profound, seeing as they are outside the habits of people who aren't always trying to make eye-opening novel ordered statements, which is closer to how I see the profound.
The authors' selection of 'conventionally profound' statements such as "A wet person does not fear the rain" aren't actually profound, they are quite literally as plain as rain.
The authors mention detecting bullshit is not a matter of 'indiscriminate skepticism' but 'a discernment of deceptive vagueness', whereby they clearly don't understand that the whole field of pragmatic inference requires vagueness.
The authors argue that 'bullshit is a real and consequential phenomenon' by saying 'there is little question about it', however, I would argue that the phrase 'bullshit' is a 'bullshit phrase' that requires the experience of an attitude towards 'colouring up an opinion' as well as the knowledge of it's use in situations like: "I still need 100 words on my essay", "oh, just fill it up with bullshit", or "I just bullshit my way through that exam", both of which convey the idea that "classwork" and "effort" are bullshit, because the speaker is trying to convey that "they don't give a shit" about trying to express themselves professionally when not in a professional setting (hence they use the word "bullshit" outside of class), and outside of the professional setting they enjoy degrading the effort that goes into classwork (hence they use the word "bullshit" to refer to classwork).
I would further argue that the abstraction of "bullshit" is easily picked up by another person, but is very much like the case of a parent picking up on slang, without realising the urban definition, for example "cuck", because bullshit, in Hindu culture has been symbolised with a psychedelic mushroom, and people who partake often end up "talking out of their ass" about all the experiences they had, when someone who hasn't touched it will call it a "Hallucination", someone who's done the research will see that it "increases visual acuity and peripheral vision", and someone who has done it will pose questions like "what's 'real' anyway?"
The authors continue to state that "random syntatically correct statements" are "bullshit" without recognizing that one can randomly generate Plato's Republic or Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
The authors go on to discuss "bullshitter" and "bullshittee", without realizing that the concept "bullshit" is a bullshit concept, so by going into detail about what bullshit is, is to become a "bullshittee", which is exactly who the authors are in writing this; by taking the term "bullshit" as capable of being scientific, they have now become receptive to a mere randomly generated buzzword.
The authors state "vagueness and meaning are, by definition, at cross purposes", when I would argue that it is actually axiomatics and vagueness that are, not at cross purposes, but two separable parts of a whole, where words can have rigorous definitions (axiomatics) and/or rigorous synonyms (vagueness), they both achieve the same goal of conveying meaning by two different but necessary paths.
The authors quote Gilbert and Spinoza with "humans must first believe something to comprehend it" which is diametrically opposed to my preferred quote from Socrates "it is the mark of an educated man to entertain a thought without accepting it".
The authors get Amazon's Mechanical Turks to self-report on questions about their Numerical and Verbal abilities and religious beliefs, without producing an active test. Thus, their results show nothing more than "a person's answers correlate with their other answers".
The authors neglect to mention that Chopra, with millions of twitter followers probably contributes a significant amount to the generation of buzzwords, thus he is being double sampled and it is no surprise he correlates with himself, seeing as he is indeed a best-seller.

I have noticed a number of minor issues in my body, like not enough memory, blissfulness, happiness, not enough learning, occasionally a dangerously high heart rate without exercise, low blood perfusion in my extremities without low blood pressure, decaying elastin content, lack of wings on my back, missing a tail and two extra arms for my beer and cigarettes. Either that or I'm lacking endogenous alcohol and nicotine production. I'm allergic to black cats and slightly intolerant to lactose and pork and my bones crack easily in the knees, neck, back, fingers, elbow and toes. I also have an aversion to vegetables low in phytochemicals and other beneficial medicines. Thus, I'm making a dietary gardening list to explore companion planting and HPLC-oriented breeding.

 

Hibiscus
The aqueous calyx extract of Hibiscus lowers blood pressure and heart rate by sympathetic dependent mechanisms. Around 3% and 5% at 15mg/kg, respectively. And a whole bunch of other healthy things.

Cocoa
High cocoa flavanols improve peripheral and cerebral blood perfusion.

Garlic
Garlic increases the temperature of acral (peripheral) skin.

Red Sage (Salvia mitorrhiza)
Increases cardiac output and myocardial microperfusion. It also relaxes knee joints, and kills some breast cancer. Eat the hairy roots.

Cannabis
THC lowers blood pressure and heart rate.

Coffee
Caffeine prevents tumor development through the adenosine receptor and increases systemic blood flow.

Lantana camara
Prevents Leishmaniasis, and Nematodes, and many insects, like those attacking stored grain.. It prevents ulcers and diabetes. Reported safe for children. It can also be brewed into ethanol. And biofabricates nanogold. But it kills mice, so maybe just grow and not eat.

Brassica oleracea var italica
Wild cabbage produces Human Growth Hormone in it's roots, an extraction and ingestion process is in order.

Ginseng
Improves testosterone, cortisol, insulin like growth factor 1 and growth hormone.

Thrombolytic plants could be of use to prevent age related deep vein thrombosis. There's a few. To look at getting. Although most seem hard to find seeds for.

Alcohol, we've already adapted to, it's clear that evolution isn't just convergent and divergent, but also concurrent. Many things are selected for throughout the population all at once. Some people don't get hangovers, and all of us urinate a lot more when it's in our system. Some things take millions of years, others mere generations.

Salvia
Salvia reduces pain in both neuropathic and inflammatory models. This is high impact support for it being a therapeutic alternative for a disabling health problem. It is a member of the mint family, indigenous to Oaxaca, Mexico, and is traditionally used in healing. The kind of abuse patients are receiving in what is declared 'science' is to restrict the set-and-setting to being asked questions every 2 minutes for 60 minutes. But, it was bound to be done at least once in forever, one great technique is to take it and listen to one of each type of podcast for an hour. The meanings of words are manipulable and the fourth wall starts to break, it absolutely shatters if the TV is on as well. But it depends on the dose, watching the grass grow is incredibly interesting on even a very light dose. Going to breakthrough is exhilarating but freaky, because that's the degradation point of the amplification.

In my experience consciousness altering substances perform a kind of perceptual echo that resonates until it shatters and leaves you in some combined interplay of how much of 'what it means to be' can be garnered from the contents of your mind, whether or not you can complete the question. Periods of stretching and vibrating or reality breaking sharpen up until a new normal, the breaking of reality becomes just another reality, you stay and are allowed to eat and rest a while, as you learn the lore of bliss, and then the breaks become less common and the plateau rolls on out to what is a new reality with different glitches, one that you'll either have to think yourself out of or take a high dose for. Each high dose is like an ascension into the next level or reality, just as the 'levels' of light change in the sharpening of reality unto breaking point, we ascend through breaking points unto ... in truth, I could write for an eternity's end in discussing the finer points of my thoughts, because as patterns are perceived in the writing out of my own thoughts, I discover that I learn faster than I can write about, and so the task is not to write, but to learn. Tripping creates a vocabulary of memory that requires endless amounts reasoning to explain any single word, and leaves someone being incapable of moving forward because of the length of time it takes to discuss the difference between what we each mean and how one meaning is different from the other, all is inherently arbitrary but suggested to organise consciously from a point of view, but by using a word in a way that you think about it can create a trip for you that is entirely not "what you think it's going to be" and not "not what you think it's going to be" and is more like "no one could ever describe what this is" and "i'm surprised this kind of thing exists", but "what you put in determines what you get out". And when you put that in they call it "cause and effect", but yeah, no, this is invisible and much bigger than that, it's not like picking up a cup, but why you picked up the cup, how you worked that out, why you exist in the first place and where the first place is to start with, all of that comes back to answering why when you pick up a cup and thought about x then y then z, that lead you to understanding a through z, which was described in the very next sentence on the podcast you were listening to. It's almost as if the dream worlds and imagination are all one world, and reality is simply the term for a temporary consistency in what's allowed to exist and how it's allowed to change. Smoking a cone of this is just a sign to the reality programmers that you're ready for a quantum leap in understanding the fabric of reality, all made by some higher dream self's conscious decision, as if when reality get's so good it's super-abundance leads to the mass adoption of gaming that in-turn become the realities we learn to create games on. So the game I'm playing is as good as it gets so far in the real world, while in this world our games aren't yet good enough to replace reality always for all, like we are on an inter-dimensional cross time-line quest to explore every possibility in every order while being in the best possible order, some possibilities are just so sour that they have to be experienced within another possibility to provide a reference point for how bad things aren't, like the concept of hell here, of which many are tempted to give reasoning as to how you can be banished, but being banished to giving out reasoning on how people get banished is a form of banishment unto itself.

 

More people report Salvia being like another environment, with beings and ego dissolution than LSD. It's not addictive, but after smoking it for months and then quitting one goes through nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, and gut pain for a few days. One lady took it 3 times a week and was cured of depression. And it prevents cocaine addiction. It's a powerful anti-inflammatory. It's effects aren't mediated by 5-HT2A and it's a non-nitrogenous kappa-opioid receptor agonist. Young adults do it for fun or to relieve boredom, and adults do it for spiritual effects, and is just a curiosity. 

Psychedelics and ...
5-HT2A signalling underlie psychedelic-induced plasticity, as well as TrkB and mTOR.

For 5-HT2A, TrKB and mTOR: LSD, Ketamine, Psilocybin, 2C-B.

For TrKB: Nardostachys jatamansi (muskroot), Epimedium brevicornum (horny goat weed), Silybum marianum (milk thistle), Echinacea angustifolia, and Polygala tenuifolia (yuan zhi).

 

 

A recent paper was published, describing exactly what I knew was a contentious issue and assumed the scientist's side of the story:

"Finally, we argue that molecular ’springboards’, such as phenotypic heterogeneity and promiscuous interactions facilitate this process by providing access to new adaptive paths."

Promiscuity is a funny way to put it, but when you attack this area of the world from the mind rather than the heart, you get the mind's answer. When you ask of the heart it says, that parents relay the way they treat each other onto their children and that there may be a more overriding Nurture at play than the Nature of enzymes that simply allow you to not die as often or as easily as your neighbour.

If I were to genetically engineer a human into the optimus prime of biology, it would not be to reproduce at great numbers in competition, but to go beyond the need for reproduction as caused by death. It's that which allows you to reproduce at great ages that is to be sought after, and is why many of the most interesting syndromes are caused by age, this is the territory.

The wine we keep is the one that ages better, if it ages at all. Hopefully it ages really well really quickly and lasts as long as if it were always fresh. We don't want to evolve to become Rabbits, surely we learnt this lesson an age ago?
