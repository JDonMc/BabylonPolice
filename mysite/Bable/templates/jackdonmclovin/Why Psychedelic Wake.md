# Why Psychedelic Wake
## The name, the idea, the concept

Not only is there a Wake of novelty travelling from the psychedelic boat that took off in the 70’s, but psychedelics generate a profound sense of wakefulness. Wake is also a synonym for aftermath, I love math to the point of sacredness and am caught in an aftermath from the use of psychedelics. In too many ways have they inspired my thinking and granted me ‘handfuls’ of perception.

I’m left picking up the pieces of myself after being blasted into countless infinities that at the time felt more real than anything I can otherwise encounter. True objects of shear mathematics in the fractal surfing domain and bountiful flowings of euphoria and bewilderment at staggering ‘truth’s’ of perception that, at the time, feel like they cannot possibly be a misunderstanding.

Psychedelics have brought me wonder and humility above anything else. A radiant sense of divinity in a state that no other deserves the name of: “Heaven”.

Sure, Dr Humphrey Osmond suggested that to fathom Hell or soar angelic, simply take a pinch of psychedelic. And Hell is indeed incommensurably fathomable, but to me they are simply Valley’s of the Shadow of Death, once the mountain has been climbed, the view is unbeatably priceless. And once seen only begs to be seen again, and for others to see it. Akin to witnessing the face of God or living once as a rich person compared to complete non-existence.

Perhaps I can integrate this sense into my life and cultivate a perspective of it in others. A utopia is only as beautiful as it appears to the minds that behold it.

After ‘why’ I’ll take ‘how’.
