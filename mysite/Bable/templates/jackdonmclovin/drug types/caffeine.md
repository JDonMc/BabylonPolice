Caffeine
Salvia
Caffeine use has reported to have the following effects:

Adenosine A1 receptor increased by 20% density (slows metabloic activity, found throughout body)

Adenosine A2A unaltered (myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow)

Beta 1 & Beta 2 Adrenergic reduced 25% (cardiac output, other things)

corticalα1 and α2 not significantly altered (smooth muscle relaxtation)

striatal D1 and D2 Dopa unaltered (dopamine receptors)

cortical 5 HT1 and 5 HT2 density increased 26-30% (various effects)

muscarinic and nicotinic receptors increase by 40-50% (receptors for CNS, effects vary)

benzodiazepine binding sites associated with GABA vA increased 65% (varied effects, mostly "calming")

cortical MK-801 unaltered (inhibits overexcited neurotransmitters)

cortical nitrendipine-binding sites associated with calcium channels is increased by 18% (treats hypertension)

I vote that in order of appearance, this is good to slow metabolism, good to reduce cardiac output, got to increase 5HT receptor density, good to increase nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, good to increase benzo sites, and good to treat hypertension. My heart rate is high, and throughput of food also, so slowing these two will prolong ageing and minimise the need to eat. 5HT, nicotine and muscarine are all nice to have more of, for thinking, learning and muscle memory. Good to remain calm and good to not scar blood vessels.

All in all, I take large doses of caffeine throughout the day.
