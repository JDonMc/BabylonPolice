Mean what you say!

But in order to mean what you say you must first say what you mean.

But in order to say what you mean you must first know what you can mean.

How do you know what you mean if you don't know to say how to express it. (Ineffability Problem)

But in order to know what you can mean you must first know how to express what can be meant.

But in order to know how to express what can be meant you must first know what it means that is expressed.

But in order to know what it means that is expressed you must first know how it is defined to mean.

But in order to know how it is defined to mean you must know who it is expressed to, and who from, and in what context. (The start point, the end point, and the channel)

The path to meaning what you say is long.

Is the long one the one to go down on?
