- user-selected monetization/incentive mechanism options being: reward per link-click (equivalent to per view) (**share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another user viewing (**local-share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another one of your links clicked (**funneled-share-alike-incentive**); reward per link-click resulting in another user clicking another one of your links (**funneled-local-share-alike-incentive**);

### CacheGit

## Set up CacheCommit mod the commit method in a fork of Git
which is a includes an optional extra flag -ts like the -m flag, except it takes in a date and a time down to the minute on a randomised second, and sets up a time-triggered shell script, like a auto-updater or a live-app, or a desktop toolbar (top on mac, bottom right on windows) to submit the commit at that time, as long as it is after the other commits with a -ts. \"dd/mm/yyyy/hh:mm\" where \":\" \",\" \"/\" are all equivalents. optionally add \"ss\" at one or two digits, and specifies the detail of the randomness, ie. set it at the start of that minute, or set it at the end, or don't set it, or set it in the middle. Because you may want to include one at the start of the minute, or at the end of a minute or in the middle, if you want to make it not conflict with other commands around that minute, so they can be stacked with other trigger commands (in case you want to auto-trigger a set of minutes for a set of commits that are divided from one big commit, and the overall commit message can be auto-attached to be subdivided and then expanded on for the appropriate areas of the code (break on file-edits per file, add filename; break on files-class-edits per class, add file-class-edit name; break on class-function edits per function, add class-function name; and others for other file types (.md .txt .doc .docx .img .png .jpeg .gif (then the same can be done for image edits into sequential steps, to show the process of photoshop and then train an AI to do it, so each step can be generative)))

And a secondary optional flag -
