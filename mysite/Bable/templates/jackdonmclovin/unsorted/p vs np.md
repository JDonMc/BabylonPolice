Cook-Levin theorem on wikipedia states that: "An important consequence of this theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then every NP problem can be solved by a deterministic polynomial time algorithm."

Now, the important thing to recognise is that a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability actually exists, it's just that the definition of what polynomial time is, is different from person to person. The algorithm is the boundary of P and NP, or the encoding from one to the other. And the situation is that the exponential function is equivalent to an infinite series of polynomials. Thus, NP is merely an infinite series of P.

Thus, all NP problems are solvable in P time, so long as you can count to an infinite accuracy of P.

It's not a question of P or NP, but of discreteness and continuity.

Seeing as NP algorithms require one of two things, irrational discreteness, or irrational continuity, and the second includes the first. Because, the polynomial algorithms that encodes NP require very very accurate numbers for the polynomial multipliers, or an infinite amount of them.

Either way, knowing the answer to an NP question, skips all time to compute it.

The problem is in the calculable discreteness of P. If you can't define every actual number (those between 0 and 1) then you can't count at all, comparably.
